# MatlabPlot
Regression Analysis and Visualization
This project provides a MATLAB-based tool for performing regression analysis and visualizing the results. It is designed to work with datasets containing experimental (actual) and predicted values. The tool generates scatter plots, regression lines, and error bounds, and also includes histograms for data distribution. Key evaluation metrics such as AAE (Average Absolute Error) and R² (coefficient of determination) are displayed alongside the plots for better model evaluation.

Features:
Scatter plot with predicted vs. actual values.
Regression line to visualize the fit.
Error bounds (±20%) for model error estimation.
Histograms for both actual and predicted values.
Customizable display of model evaluation metrics.
Requirements:
MATLAB (compatible with recent versions).
Usage:
Prepare your dataset with actual and predicted values.
Call the plotRes2Pre function to visualize the regression results.
View the evaluation metrics and performance.
This tool is ideal for those working with regression models in MATLAB who need a quick and easy way to visualize their results and assess model performance.
